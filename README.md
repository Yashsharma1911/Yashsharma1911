Hi there,

Presently, I work as a full-time maintainer of the CNCF project [Meshery](https://github.com/meshery/meshery). I mainly maintain the server side of Meshery and its cloud using Go, and I help the Meshery project increase its open-source adoption. I have been contributing to open source for more than two years now and usually contribute to projects related to Kubernetes and the CNCF.

Apart from my technical contributions, I have been hosting Meshery Dev, CI/CD, and newcomers [meetings](https://youtu.be/tQrtLIpjAy0) for two years and helping Meshery contributors on their path to success within the project. With that said, I have been a [mentor](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/d494f314-ed16-478b-8a0f-9ed259e7ee11) for various open-source initiatives like LFX and the Layer5 MeshMate program. As a maintainer, advocacy for the project is part of my role, which is why I have been a speaker at conferences like KubeCon China and have represented Meshery at KubeCon India and various other local and international conferences. [Checkout my talks](https://github.com/Yashsharma1911/programs). I’m also part of CNCF initiatives like the CNCF TAG Network and the CNCF BIPOC Charter as a volunteer.

I love working on hard problems, Go, Kubernetes, and advocating for the projects I contribute to. I’m also looking for new opportunities. Feel free to drop a message at yashsharma2572@gmail.com if you have a lead or want to discuss anything with me.
